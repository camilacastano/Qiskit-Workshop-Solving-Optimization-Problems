# Qiskit-Workshop-Solving-Optimization-Problems

These notebooks are part of my 1 week workshop on Quantum Computing using Qiskit as the main tool (package). 

## unal_workshop_3_opt.ipynb

It is the teaching-oriented notebook, which is structures step-by-step on quantum optimization (QUBO, VQE, QAOA). Just for conceptual understanding on how classical optimization becomes quantum.

## q_hackaton.ipynb

Minimal implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to a graph-based optimization problem. 

* Important dependencies: _qiskit, networkx, qiskit_optimization_

## hackaton.ipynb

Presents a more advanced approach and shows a real-world optimization problem solved using Qiskit's built-in tools. Divided by 2 parts:

1. The first one being the Vertex Cover Problem, where the goal is to select the minimum number of nodes such that every edge is covered.
2. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
